# 📘 Beginner's Guide: FileFlow Studio
## *A Step-by-Step, Jargon-Free Guide to Organizing, Renaming, and Automating Your Files*

---

## 🌟 1. What is FileFlow Studio? (In Plain English)

Imagine you have thousands of photos, songs, invoices, or movies scattered across your computer—disorganized, with messy names, or taking up way too much storage space.

Doing all of this by hand (copying, pasting, renaming one by one, unzipping...) would take days of boring work.

**FileFlow Studio** is like a **smart factory conveyor belt**:
1. On one end, you place a folder full of files.
2. In the middle, you connect *"workstations"* (called **Boxes** or **Nodes**) that perform tasks: renaming, sorting by date, compressing, converting videos, etc.
3. Your files travel through connections ("wires") from one box to another.
4. At the end, everything is clean, organized, and in its exact place in just a few seconds.

> [!TIP]
> **You do not need to know any programming or advanced computer skills.** Everything is done with your mouse: drag, drop, and connect wires.

## 🛡️ 2. Peace of Mind First: The Maximum Safety Principle

Many people are afraid of using automation software in case it deletes or messes up their important photos or documents. With **FileFlow Studio**, you are 100% protected:

1. **Your original files are never altered by default:** All transformations create neat copies in new folders.
2. **The Magic "Virtual Simulation" Button (Dry Run):** You can test any workflow without moving a single real file. The app shows you an exact simulation of what it would do before you press the real button.
3. **The "Undo" Button (Ctrl+Z / Rollback):** If you run a flow and change your mind, click the **Undo** button and all files immediately return to their original names and locations.
4. **Operating System Trash / Recycle Bin:** If you ever decide to delete files on purpose, the program never permanently destroys them; it sends them to the OS Recycle Bin / Trash (Windows, Linux, macOS) so you can recover them at any time.

**The Solution:**
1. To Download: Add the **"Network Download Hub"** box (`NetworkDownloadNode`), select your protocol (e.g. `SFTP` or `WebDAV`), and fill in your connection details.
2. To Upload: Add the **"Network Upload Hub"** box (`NetworkUploadNode`) at the end of any pipeline to push results straight to your server.

### 📊 Recipe 8: Automatic Watchdog Mode (Process Files as They Land)

**The Problem:** You want new files added to your Downloads or Inbox folder to be sorted automatically in the background without manually launching FileFlow Studio every time.

**The Solution:**
1. Build your flow (e.g. `FolderSource` $\rightarrow$ `Filter` $\rightarrow$ `MoveFile`).
2. Click the **"👁️ Vigilante" (Watchdog)** button in the top bar.
3. The button illuminates in vibrant emerald green. You can now minimize the app: whenever a new file lands in the folder, it is immediately processed automatically.

### 🧪 Recipe 9: Testing Pipelines with "Mock Test Files" & Virtual File System (100% Risk-Free)

**The Problem:** You are building an advanced pipeline (camera-based photo renamer, archive unpacker, invoice sorter...) but do not want to risk real personal files or do not have sample files handy.

**The Solution:**
1. Add the **"Synthetic Data Generator"** box (`SyntheticDataSourceNode`) instead of a real folder scanner.
2. Select an out-of-the-box domain in the inspector: *"Movies"*, *"TV Series"*, *"Music"* (with realistic ID3 tags), *"Photos"* (with Sony, Canon, Nikon EXIF data), or *"Documents"* (invoices and balance sheets).
3. Want to design your own custom folders and test files? Click **"🎨 Diseñar Conjuntos de Datos..."** in the right inspector:
   - Create custom directory trees with intuitive indented text (Fast Tree DSL) or a simple visual table.
   - You can even simulate compressed `.zip` archives with inner files!
4. Connect your destination nodes (Rename, Move, Save...) and click **"▶ Run Workflow"**.
5. **The Magic Behind It:** Zero files are created on your actual hard drive! Everything is written safely into an in-memory **Virtual File System (VFS)**.
6. When the execution finishes, click the new **"🗂️ VFS"** button in the top bar:
   - Inspect the generated virtual folder hierarchy, operation status badges (*Saved*, *Moved*, *Renamed*), and rich metadata.
   - If satisfied, click *"Open in Explorer"* to export the sandbox or switch to real folder inputs with confidence.

### 👁️ The Spacebar Trick (QuickLook Instant Previewer)
Want to check how a photo turned out, read an extracted document, or review metadata tables without opening third-party tools?
1. Click on any file in the console or a card on the canvas.
2. Press the **Spacebar**.
3. A sleek preview window pops up showing images, text, and metadata tables on the fly! Press `Spacebar` or `Esc` again to close it.

## 🎨 6. Canvas Productivity & Organization Tips

* **Sticky Notes:** Right-click an empty canvas area and choose **"Create Sticky Note"** to add colorful notes, guidelines, or reminders directly on the workspace.
* **Group Frames (`Ctrl+G`):** Select multiple related boxes by dragging a selection rectangle and press `Ctrl+G`. They will be enclosed in an interactive group frame with a customizable title that moves all boxes together.

## ❓ 7. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. What happens if the power goes out while processing?
FileFlow Studio processes each file atomically and records checkpoints automatically. Nothing is corrupted. When you restart the app, it automatically resumes and skips already completed files.

### 2. How do I know when the flow is finished?
The top progress bar fills with green and the bottom console outputs a final summary: *"Workflow completed successfully! X files processed in Y seconds"*.

### 3. Can I save my workflows for daily use?
Yes! Click **"Save Workflow As..."** in the side drawer (or press `Ctrl+S`). You can save as many workflows as you want (e.g., *"CleanDownloads.flow"* or *"OrganizePhotos.flow"*). To reuse it, simply open the saved file and click Run or Watchdog.

A workflow saved with an older version of FileFlow Studio **brings itself up to date when you open and save it**: your wires stay where they were and the file ends up current without you doing anything else. And if a file was written by a newer version, the application warns you before overwriting it and offers to save it under another name, so nothing is ever lost.

### 4. What do the colored status circles on each box mean?
* ⚪ **Gray (Idle):** The box is waiting for incoming files.
* 🟡 **Yellow / Blue (Working):** The box is actively processing an item right now.
* 🟢 **Green (Completed):** Finished processing all items successfully.
* 🔴 **Red (Faulted / Alert):** An issue occurred with a file (e.g., disk was full or a document was locked by Word). You can read the exact reason in the console below.
