## 1. Introduction & Architectural Philosophy

**FileFlow Studio** is a modern visual workflow automation engine and batch file transformation platform inspired by state-of-the-art tools like *n8n*, *ComfyUI*, and *Node-RED*, engineered specifically on **.NET 10** and **C# 14**.

### Core Tenets:
- **🛡️ Non-Destructive by Default**: Input files (`OriginalPath`) are never modified or destroyed in place. Source file lifecycle manipulation (preserving, quarantining, recycling, or deleting) is strictly delegated to the specialized `OriginalFileActionNode`.
- **🧩 Decoupled Microkernel Architecture (ADR-006)**: Every plugin domain (`FileFlow.Plugin.*`) is completely autonomous with zero UI dependencies and co-located localization resources (`Strings.resx` / `Strings.es.resx`).
- **⚡ High-Performance Asynchronous Channels**: Multi-threaded parallel processing powered by `System.Threading.Channels` and `TPL Dataflow`, achieving over **82,000 telemetry events/second**.
- **🌐 Universal Network Symmetry**: Unified download and upload hubs covering **HTTP/HTTPS**, **FTP/FTPS**, **SFTP/SSH**, **WebDAV/Nextcloud**, and **SMB/Windows Shares** with reactive parameter visibility.

---

## 2. Visual Editor Core Concepts

### Interactive Node Canvas (DAG)
Model pipelines by dragging and connecting nodes from the **Toolbox**:
- **Toolbox with Category Dropdown Filter**: The left panel features a category dropdown filter (`ComboBox`) with dynamic pill badges showing node counts and instant text search. Categories are presented in high-contrast cards, and subordinate nodes with clean hierarchical indentation.
- **Input Ports (Left Edge)**: Receive incoming items (`In`, `BranchA`, `Files`).
- **Output Ports (Right Edge)**: Emit transformed files or conditional branch items (`Out`, `Done`, `Error`, `Matched`, `Unmatched`).
- **Advanced Selection & Canvas Manipulation**:
  - *Mixed Rubberband Selection*: Drag on the canvas to select both nodes and connecting wires simultaneously.
  - *Additive Multi-Selection*: Hold `Ctrl` while clicking or dragging to add items to selection.
  - *Atomic Delete*: Press `Delete` to remove selected nodes and wires in a single undoable (`Ctrl+Z`) and redoable (`Ctrl+Y`) transaction.
- **Status LED**:
  - ⚪ *Idle*: Waiting for input items.
  - 🔵 *Pulsing Blue (Running)*: Processing files in real time.
  - 🟢 *Green (Completed)*: Successfully finished batch.
  - 🔴 *Red (Faulted)*: Error captured (routed to `Error` port without halting the pipeline).
- **Breakpoint Toggle**: Click the red circle icon to pause execution when a file arrives at the node.

### File Item Pipeline Context (`FileItemContext`)
The fundamental data record travelling across workflow connections:
```csharp
public sealed record FileItemContext
{
    public Guid Id { get; init; } = Guid.NewGuid();
    public string CurrentPath { get; set; }       // Current file path in the pipeline step
    public string OriginalPath { get; init; }      // Immutable source path
    public long FileSizeBytes { get; set; }        // Exact byte size
    public bool IsDirectory { get; set; }
    public Dictionary<string, object?> Metadata { get; } // Enriched key-value data (EXIF, Hash, OCR, AI)
    public HashSet<string> Tags { get; }          // Quick taxonomy tags
    public List<string> ExecutionLog { get; }     // Audit transformation trail
}
```

### Nested Sub-workflows & Macros (Breadcrumbs)
Encapsulate complex pipelines into reusable composite nodes:
1. Double-click a sub-workflow node to enter its internal editor.
2. The top breadcrumb bar tracks hierarchy: `Root Workflow ❯ Extraction Macro ❯ Sanitization`.
3. Click any parent breadcrumb to commit changes and return to the main canvas.

### Real-time Connection Telemetry Badges
Each wire dynamically renders a live counter badge (e.g., `⚡ 2,450 items`) with direct Bézier geometry rooted at port socket anchors.

### Node Inspector, Settings & Modal Dialogs
- **Node Inspector Panel**: Segmented tab bar navigation with grouped parameter cards and contextual action buttons (`{x}` for Variable Catalog, `🏷️` for Advanced Renamer pipeline, `🎬` for Media Presets, `🔑` for Password Manager). Closing the inspector immediately reclaims 100% canvas space.
- **Settings Dialog**: Segmented tab bar switching smoothly between Storage, Appearance & Language, Performance, Tools, AI Models, and Updates.
- **Rich Interactive Modal Dialogs**: Responsive WinUI 3 dialog surfaces supporting mouse wheel scrolling, live manual corner resizing, and maximize/restore toggles (`[+]` / `[-]`).
- **QuickLook Previewer**: Press `Spacebar` or click `👁️ QuickLook` on any node or log entry to inspect images, documents, raw text, or metadata tables.

### Opening and Saving Flows: the File Format Version
Every saved flow declares the format it was written in, and the application takes care of the rest:
- **A flow saved with an older version of the format is repaired when opened.** Design data that version never stored —for example, the ports a sub-workflow container exposed— is recovered from its own wires, and anything that could not be rebuilt is reported in the console and in the status bar instead of being dropped silently.
- **Saving it moves the file to the current format**, so it stops being repaired: open once, save, and the file is up to date. Right after opening and before saving, the file on disk is left as it was.
- **A flow written by a newer version is never overwritten.** It opens in full, and if you try to save over it the application warns you and offers another path, so the fields that version added are not lost.

## 3. Execution Modes & Data Safety

### Standard Parallel Execution
Press **"▶ Run Workflow"** (`F5`) to process files using hardware-aware adaptive concurrency.

### Virtual Simulation Mode ("Dry Run")
1. Check **"Dry Run"** before execution.
2. The engine computes paths, checks conditions, generates hashes, and resolves templates **without writing, moving, or deleting any files on disk**.
3. Inspect planned operations (`PlannedAction`) in the console prior to committing.

### Continuous Real-time Watchdog Mode
- Toggle **"👁️ Watchdog Mode"** to monitor input folders for new files and trigger processing immediately on disk events.

### Transactional LIFO Rollback System
If you need to revert changes:
1. Click **"↩ Rollback"** on the control bar.
2. Operations (renames, relocations) are undone in reverse order (Last-In, First-Out).

### Interactive Debugging with Breakpoints
- Click **"🐛 Debug Workflow"**.
- Execution halts when an item reaches a breakpoint.
- Use **"Step Into (F10)"** to advance node by node while observing live metadata diffs in the inspector.

### Virtual File System (VFS) & Non-Destructive Test Bench
To design, validate, and debug complex pipelines without manipulating real disks or endangering production files:
1. **Automated Zero-Config Activation**:
   - Adding a **`SyntheticDataSourceNode`** or tagging items as virtual (`IsVirtual = true`) causes the DAG engine (`WorkflowExecutor`) to transparently instantiate an in-memory Virtual File System store (`IVirtualFileSystemStore`).
   - File sink and relocation nodes (**`DestinationSinkNode`**, **`FileRelocatorNode`**, **`SafeRecycleDeleteNode`**, **`OriginalFileActionNode`**) automatically detect the virtual execution context and redirect their writes, copies, moves, and logical deletions to the VFS store without I/O errors or cluttering local storage.
2. **Visual VFS Explorer (`VirtualFileSystemExplorerBody`)**:
   - Once a run completes with virtual items, the control bar displays a reactive badge button **`🗂️ VFS (N)`** indicating total virtual files generated. It is also permanently accessible via the side navigation Drawer.
   - **3-Pane Split View**:
     - *Directory Tree*: Interactive recursive folder hierarchy created in memory.
     - *File Table*: Detailed view with operation badges (`Saved`, `Copied`, `Moved`, `ConflictRenamed`, `Recycled`, `Deleted`).
     - *Metadata Inspector*: Right sidebar categorized by domain (Photo/EXIF, Music/Audio ID3, Video, Documents/Fiscal, and Cryptographic SHA/MD5 hashes).
   - **Export & Diagnostics Tools**:
     - `📋 Copy ASCII Tree`: Copies a formatted ASCII tree diagram to the clipboard.
     - `📂 Open in Explorer`: Safely exports the in-memory VFS hierarchy into a temporary sandbox folder (`%TEMP%/FileFlow_VFS_Sandbox/...`) and opens it in the native operating system file manager.

### Synthetic Data Set Designer
Allows users to create, modify, persist, and reuse custom test datasets with customized directory trees:
- **Direct Entry Points**:
  1. `🎨 Diseñar Conjuntos de Datos...` custom action button in `SyntheticDataSourceNode` inspector.
  2. `📊 Diseñador...` button on the sample toolbar in `AdvancedRenamerBody`.
  3. `📊 Diseñador de Datos Sintéticos` menu item in the main window Drawer.
- **Dataset Catalog & Sidebar**:
  - Live search filter by name and category.
  - Counters showing item count, directory count, and simulated archives.
  - Create (`➕ New`), Duplicate (`📄 Duplicate`), and Delete (`🗑️ Delete`) actions with protection for built-in system datasets (`IsBuiltIn`).
  - Thread-safe persistence in `%AppData%/FileFlow/SyntheticDataSets/*.json`.
- **Three Synchronized Editing Modes**:
  - **📋 Visual Table**: Cell-by-cell editing of relative paths (`RelativePath`), byte sizes, `Is Directory` and `Is Archive` flags, and metadata dictionaries.
  - **🌲 Fast Tree (DSL)**: Lightning-fast indented text editor with a bidirectional hierarchical parser. Press `🔄 Apply Changes` to sync with the visual table.
  - **📄 Raw JSON**: Inspect, format, copy, or paste raw JSON dataset definitions.

#### Fast Tree DSL Syntax:
```dsl
# Hierarchical tree definition with metadata and inner archive entries
Photos/
    2026/
        beach.jpg (3.5MB, Exif:CameraModel=Sony A7 IV, Exif:ISO=100)
        trip.zip (15MB) [archive: track.gpx (12KB); notes.txt (5KB)]
Documents/
    Invoices/
        Invoice_001.pdf (250KB, Doc:Author=Accounting, FiscalYear=2026)
Music/
    Daft Punk/
        Discovery/
            01 - One More Time.flac (35MB, Audio:Artist=Daft Punk, Audio:Track=01)
```
- **Directories**: End with `/` or omit file extensions.
- **Human-readable Sizes**: Declared inside parentheses `(500B)`, `(15KB)`, `(3.5MB)`, `(1.2GB)`.
- **Inline Metadata**: Key-value pairs inside parentheses: `(2MB, Audio:Artist=Queen)`.
- **Inner Archive Entries**: Declared at the end of the line using `[archive: inner1.txt (500B); inner2.png (2MB)]`.

### Hybrid Compressed Archive Simulation (ZIP, RAR, 7Z)
- **Direct Virtual Extraction (VFS)**: When a simulated archive item flows into **`SmartUnpackNode`**, the node recognizes that the item is virtual or contains `Archive:Entries` metadata and unpacks its internal entries directly into `IVirtualFileSystemStore` preserving subfolder hierarchies and individual metadata tags, without physical disk reading.
- **Real File Generation in `PhysicalMock` Mode**: When `SyntheticDataSourceNode` runs in physical mode, it automatically generates a real lightweight `.zip` archive via `System.IO.Compression.ZipArchive` containing the simulated inner files, allowing testing of external CLI unpackers and third-party tools against physical mock data.
